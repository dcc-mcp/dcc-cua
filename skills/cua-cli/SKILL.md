# Standalone dcc-cua CLI

This project is an independent CUA control plane. It does not depend on Maya
MCP, a DCC adapter, `dcc-mcp-cli`, or generic Computer Use. Use the released
`dcc-cua` binary, which talks to the CUA SDK and Host IPC directly.

## Control loop

1. Discover the real target before acting:

   ```powershell
   dcc-cua doctor
   dcc-cua list --on-screen
   dcc-cua list --app maya.exe --on-screen
   dcc-cua profiles
   ```

2. Bind one exact process/window. Prefer `--pid` plus `--window-id`; use a
   process or title selector only for discovery and then rebind to the returned
   identity. Never widen an exact-window session to the whole desktop because a
   child surface lacks semantic nodes.

3. Use the latest observation as the only action coordinate/token source:

   ```powershell
   dcc-cua snapshot --pid $pid --window-id $hwnd --activate --output before.png
   dcc-cua act --pid $pid --window-id $hwnd --action-json '{"action":"click","element_index":12,"delivery_mode":"foreground"}'
   dcc-cua snapshot --pid $pid --window-id $hwnd --activate --output after.png
   ```

   Prefer an accessibility element index/token. Use coordinates only for a
   custom-drawn surface after a fresh pixel snapshot. A semantic action gets a
   fresh accessibility observation; do not reuse stale element indexes.

4. Verify state after every mutation. A successful input call proves that input
   was delivered, not that the application reached the requested state. Use a
   post-snapshot, changed title/tree/value, or an independent application state
   check as the acceptance oracle.

5. Use `desktop-snapshot`/`desktop-act` only for a deliberately desktop-scoped
   target that cannot be represented by an exact window. Keep the scope and
   coordinate source explicit.

## Long tasks and safety boundaries

Represent long work as checkpoints such as `discover → bind → act → verify →
next checkpoint`, with a deadline for each stage. On `desktop_unavailable`, a
disconnected session, policy/authorization failure, or `user_interrupted`, stop
the current stage and recover the environment before retrying; do not switch to
another input technology.

The ControlBanner and target frame are visible on the physical desktop so users
know control is active, while the indicator windows are excluded from CUA
observations. That is intentional and must not be “fixed” by painting the
banner into screenshots.
